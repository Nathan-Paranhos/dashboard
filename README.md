## ✅ Final Checklist for Production Readiness

This checklist outlines the final steps to make this project 100% production-ready for commercial sale.

### Phase 1: Environment & Tooling (Current Blockers)
- [ ] **Fix Local Environment:** Reinstall Node.js and npm to resolve the corrupted installation (`node_modules/.bin` directory not being created).
- [ ] **Validate Test Runner:** Confirm that `npm test` runs successfully for both frontend and backend after the environment fix.

### Phase 2: Frontend Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Write Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - [ ] Test `LoginPage` component behavior.
  - [ ] Test `Dashboard` data fetching and rendering.
  - [ ] Test `Sales` and `Products` table interactions (add, edit, delete).
  - [ ] Test form submissions and validation.
- [ ] **Achieve 80%+ Test Coverage:** Ensure critical parts of the UI are covered by automated tests.

### Phase 3: Documentation & Polish
- [ ] **Create User Manual:** Write a simple guide for end-users on how to use the dashboard's features.
- [ ] **Create Installation Guide:** Write a detailed guide for developers on how to deploy the project on their own servers.
- [ ] **Review and Refine UI/UX:** Perform a final check on all pages for any visual or usability issues.

### Phase 4: Deployment & Security
- [ ] **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:** Configure GitHub Actions to automatically run tests and linters on every push/pull request.
- [ ] **Perform Security Audit:** Review all dependencies for known vulnerabilities (`npm audit`) and check security best practices (e.g., secrets management, headers).
- [ ] **Optimize for Production:** Ensure the application is built with production settings and performs well under load.
